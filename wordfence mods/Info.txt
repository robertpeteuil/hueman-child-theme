How to route blocked users with wordfence to a custom page

unfortunately, other than country blocking (which can be changed via the UI), other blocking cusotmization needs to be done by modding the plugin files

from - https://wordpress.org/support/topic/blocked-message-from-wf-any-way-to-customize/

wp-content/plugins/wordfence

  lib/wfLockedOut.php     message for locked out - limiting access to login

  lib/wf503.php           message text for blocking
    lib/wfUnlockMsg.php   unlock message (used in 503)

------------------

  Lockout - failed logins
    only locked out from login (only)
      blocked IP displayed in blocked - IPs locked out from login
    i have them locked out for 12 hours

  Blocked - blocked if try to sign in as admin
    applies to entire site
      blocked IP displayed in blocked from accessing site
    Blocked Time set in firewall - rate limiting
      applies to both Rate Limiting & brute force lockout

-----------------

My Issues with their default behavior -
    It breaks many standard security practices in the attempt at user friendliness
      both messages state that they're generated by Wordfence
        it would be much better for them to not know why they cannot connect
        let alone, know the actual product that the website is using for protection

Specific Issues by Message Type

  blocked - says 'temporarily limited/  lease try again in a few minutes'
    specifies the reason they are temporarily locked out
    extensive text describing wordfence functionality and even mentions "advanced blocking"
    displays a sub-message asking them to enter the email address of an administrator or person set to 'receive wordfence reports' to receive an email to help regain access.
      This allows any hacker knowing the admin's email address to try to remove the block
      It also provides a hacker with a URL to an FAQ on the Wordfence website
        This FAQ is good info, for legit admins, but it should NOT be hot-linked from a lockout message

  locked out - says temporarily, and also says to 'try back in a short while'
